Task Aggregator and Job Analyzer agent

This archive contains the code for the Task Aggregator and Job Analyzer
(TAJA) agent used in the Twitter Feed Analysis project. The code can also
be found on github at https://github.com/kevinblack100/cs462/tree/dev.

The archive file should contain the following files and directories:

lab5.README.txt (this file)
shared/ (common code)
taja/ (Task Aggregator and Job Analyzer specific code)

The shared and taja directories should contain Eclipse .project files. The
shared and taja projects are also Maven projects (see the pom.xml files).

You can start the taja server in Tomcat by copying taja/target/taja.war to
the appropriate Tomcat webapps directory.

The TAJA site can be accessed at http://<your.domain>/taja/dynamic/.

Events should be sent to
http://<your.domain>/taja/dynamic/esl/public/channel.

The received and sent events can be viewed on the Event Log tab of the
site.
