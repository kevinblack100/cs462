got maven for Eclipse (m2e)
created a maven webapp project in Eclipse
couldn't create a server with the war
experimented with packaging the war
still couldn't create a server
had to make the Eclipse project faceted, and mark it as being/having a Dynamic Web Module
updated the web.xml to have a jsp-file in the servlet spec for index.jsp, all /cs462/* pages go to the index page (the cs462 context is set in the server properties, not in the war, need to figure out how this is controlled via cmd ln tools)
the Deployment Assembly property has to include /src/main/webapp/ going to / so that Tomcat can find the content where maven puts it

following notes on LDS Stack training set up spring mvc project
had to change the Eclipse project properties in order to run a tomcat server for the eclipse project

particularly Project > Properties > Deployment Assembly > Add then select "Java Build Path Entries" and select the maven dependencies
